# Block Sauce: progress

Where the build stands and what happens next. The agent adds a short entry at the top of the log for each work session, and a report when a phase's done-when is verified. Older entries and phase reports live in git history.

## Current state (2026-11-02)

**Phases 0–4 are done. Phase 4 (Character) awaits Jackson's review; win and lose stand on `Idle` until A-023. Next is Phase 5 (Sauces).**

What plays today, online with up to 8 players, in the Lobby scene:
- Guy on a force-driven capsule (0.40 m radius, his real width): walk/run (analog on gamepad), jump, sit, slide, stagger.
- Grab, hold and swing (body turns past 45°; the camera follows the swing on a gradient and never locks), place with flush settling, hold-to-aim throw with trajectory preview, jumpshot.
- Stack & Lock: 3 owned blocks each, settle dither, counting, win, full match loop back to the lobby.
- Knockdown: Guy's 11-limb ragdoll, Jump to recover faster, carrying bodies, get-up clips, dazed indicator, falling out of the world resets.
- Animation: idle; walk and run blending forward, back and strafe; jump; sit and slide; stagger flinches by hit side; GrabBlock hold with spine turn and hand IK; aim pose (`Throw` frame 4) and follow-through, grounded and airborne; foot IK on steps, ramps and blocks.

### Known issues
- Strafe feet slide: the strafe clips step about 0.16 m/s, so they're sped up 2–8× and still can't keep up (A-024).
- Sitting while holding a block keeps the block at the standing hold height; the arms reach up to it. If it reads badly, lower the hold pivot while sitting (simulation).
- While aiming, the block's model is overhead in Guy's hands but the real block (what collides, and where the aim line starts) stays 0.8 m in front at the 30° aim point. If it matters in play, move the simulation's aim point overhead and launch the throw from in front.
- With the hips dropped for a low foot, Guy's long arms can touch the ground beside him.
- Flinches were checked by playing each one through the view; a real stagger in play still needs a look (the event path is unchanged from the knockback system).
- The camera has no wall collision. Phase 6.
- A ragdoll that spawns half inside a block can launch it; the fall reset recovers it. If it shows up in play, spawn the ragdoll in a tucked pose.
- A body still airborne when its knockdown ends stands up mid-air and falls.
- A player who joins mid-match gets no blocks until the next round.
- Swing input is sent as per-tick deltas, so a repeated lost input repeats one tick of swing. Revisit only if swings feel jumpy online.
- The start menu has a stray white banner box (stock Quantum start UI, A-002).
- Matches only run in the Lobby scene; Arena_Graybox has no `Match` yet (Phase 6).

### Waiting on Jackson
- Review of Phase 4 (report below) and a play-test: sit, strafe, flinch, foot IK, the aim pose, the over-the-shoulder aim camera (0.9 m right, 0.3 m up; `OrbitCamera` › Aim Shoulder Offset) and the holding camera gradient (`OrbitCamera` › Swing Camera Share, 0.35).
- The two open questions in the plan (settle numbers; pickup swings through your own tower).

### Placeholders in use
`PH_PlayerCapsule` (Guy's view on it), `PH_Block` (with the draft `BL_Block` mesh), `PH_LockDither` (A-007/A-013), `PH_PlayerColors` (holds the real palette), `PH_` terrain (A-008), the IMGUI `MatchHud` (A-006), the stock Quantum start UI (A-002), `PH_RagdollTest` (stress-test scene only).

## Next: Phase 5 (Sauces)

Starts after Jackson's Phase 4 review. Needs A-005 (final block mesh) and A-013 (owner readability) for the coat shader; the simulation side (dip planes, strength, Stack and Slip sauce) can start on the draft block. A-023 (win and lose) slots in whenever it lands.

## Phase 4 report: Character
- Built: every player state animated on Guy. Idle; walk and run blending forward, back and strafe; jump start, loop and land; sit and slide; stagger flinches by hit side; `GrabBlock` hold with spine turn and hand IK; the aim pose (`Throw` frame 4) and follow-through, grounded and airborne; knockdown ragdoll on Guy's bones and get-up blends; foot IK on steps, ramps and blocks; capsule at Guy's 0.40 m radius. Camera: never locks while holding (gradient), moves over the shoulder while aiming.
- Done-when verification ("Guy plays a full match on uneven terrain with no state left unanimated"): two clients through MPPM (`Assets/Settings/PlayMode/TwoClients.asset`, main editor plus one clone) in one online room. Player A ran a scripted match: start, walk, run, slide into a sit, jump, grab, carry with strafes and back-steps, swing past the turn threshold, aim and throw, aim in the air and jumpshot, place, knockdown and get-up, then stood still while player B (scripted) ran into it for a real stagger, then stacked three blocks to win. The match went Lobby → Countdown → Playing → RoundEnd → Results → Lobby. A logged every Animator state each character's view reached, as seen on A:
  - A (local): Idle, Walk, Walk back, Walk strafe, Run, Run back, Run strafe, JumpStart, JumpLoop, JumpLand, Sit, Sit with the slide clip, GrabBlock, Aim (on the ground and in the air), Throw, StruckBack, StruckLeft, ragdoll, GetUpFaceDown, foot IK planted; tiers InControl and Staggered.
  - B (remote, interpolated): Idle, Walk, Run, Run strafe, JumpLoop, JumpLand, foot IK planted.
  - No state outside the controller's known ones, on any layer.
  - Win and lose: Idle during RoundEnd and Results, as decided.
  - Uneven terrain: foot IK on the Lobby's step and ramps (checked earlier today; planted in this run too).
  - A separate replay of the jumpshot: aiming on the ground, airborne at 0.61 s, thrown in the air at 1.01 s.
  - Console on both clients: no game errors.
- Known issues: see Current state (aim block offset, strafe foot slide, block height while sitting, long arms on dropped hips).
- Placeholders still in use: `PH_PlayerCapsule`, `PH_Block` (draft `BL_Block`, A-005), `PH_LockDither` (A-007/A-013), `PH_` terrain (A-008), IMGUI `MatchHud` (A-006), stock start UI (A-002); win and lose on `Idle` (A-023).
- Ready for review: yes

## 2026-11-02: Phase 4, holding camera gradient; done-when verified
- Did: the orbit camera no longer locks behind the body while holding. It turns toward the swing at 35% of the input in the middle, rising smoothly (cubic) to all of it at the 45° body-turn edge, then turns with the body; vertically it tilts the same way toward the ends of the swing pitch or throw angle and fully past them. View only (`OrbitCamera`, `LocalPlayerView`). Added the `TwoClients` MPPM scenario. Ran the done-when (report above).
- Verified: swinging right at 60°/s, the camera turned 3° → 7° → 16° while the block swung 8° → 25° → 40°, then followed the turning body; raising the block tilted the camera from 15° to −28° throughout; raising and lowering the throw aim tilted it 15° → 5° → 21°.
- Decided: the camera yaw is a function of the swing (no drift: swinging back returns it); the middle share is a tunable (`Swing Camera Share`). The Lobby scene now stores the camera's three new fields at their defaults.
- Assets: none.
- Questions for Jackson: does the gradient feel right (0.35 in the middle)?
- Next: Phase 4 review, then Phase 5.

## 2026-11-02: Phase 4, aim pose and jumpshot from Throw frame 4
- Did:
  - **Guy re-export** with the two-handed `Throw` (12 frames): integrated.
  - **Aim** (Jackson): a frozen `Aim` state on the upper-body layer holds `Throw` frame 4, the wind-up with the block overhead. The block's model rides between Guy's hands there (`HeldBlockPoseView`), while the real block stays at the 30° aim point; the torso turn and hand IK give way to the pose while aiming. Releasing plays `Throw` on from frame 4 and hands the model back to the flying block over 0.08 s.
  - **Jumpshot** uses the same pose and clip over the jump; the upper body fades back to `JumpLoop`.
  - **Aim camera:** the orbit camera moves 0.9 m right and 0.3 m up while aiming. The raised block hid the aim line and landing circle from the usual spot.
  - **Place and win/lose:** no place clip (letting go already blends out of the hold); win and lose stand on `Idle`. A-021 and A-022 removed from the asset list.
  - **Spectator and repeatable test match:** assessed and placed in Phase 6 and Phase 7 (see the plan's Decisions).
- Verified (play mode, one online client, scripted input):
  - Grounded: Aim holds at normalized time 0.333 (frame 4) for the whole hold; the block's model sits 0.72 m behind and 1.67 m above his feet, his hands on its sides. On release `Throw` runs on from 0.36, and the model closes on the real block 1.20 → 0.77 → 0.50 → 0.26 → 0.05 m over 5 ticks, then tracks it within 0.02 m.
  - Airborne: the same, not grounded throughout, jumpshot speed.
  - Captures: from the usual camera spot the raised block hid the aim; from the shoulder the line and circle are clear.
  - Console: no game errors.
- Decided: the block's model, not the simulation's block, goes overhead, so nothing in the simulation changes and a throw still launches from in front (see Known issues).
- Assets: A-021 delivered as the reworked `Throw`; A-022 dropped; A-023 stays (in development).
- Questions for Jackson: does the shoulder camera feel right while aiming?
- Next: the Phase 4 done-when with 2+ clients through MPPM.

## 2026-11-02: Phase 4, sit, strafe, flinch, foot IK, capsule
- Did:
  - **Guy re-export** (22 actions): integrated. New `Crouch` (the sit-down), `Slide`, `StrafeLeft`/`StrafeRight`, `StruckFront`/`Back`/`Left`/`Right`. Strafe and Slide now loop on import.
  - **Sit replaces crouch** (Jackson): the crouch button sits. Sitting is stationary (no steering, turning or jumping; it only brakes). Pressed while moving 4 m/s or faster it slides instead (the Run button is no longer required), ending in a sit while held. Capsule 1.30 m while sitting or sliding (his sitting head height), was 1.10. Config fields renamed: `SitHeight`, `SlideEndSpeed`; `MovementData.IsSitting`.
  - **Capsule radius 0.40 m** (was 0.35), matching Guy; collider, config and the hidden body visual updated.
  - **Animator:** Walk and Run are 2D directional blends on the move direction relative to facing (forward, back, strafe left, strafe right; strafes play 2× in Walk and 4× in Run). A Sit state blends `Crouch` into `Slide` by ground speed, entered from any state while sitting. A full-body Flinch layer plays the `Struck` clip for the side that was hit on a stagger, then fades out; skipped while sitting or down.
  - **Foot IK** (`FootIKView`): raycasts the predicted frame under each foot (statics and blocks), drops the hips for the lower foot, bends each leg to keep the foot's animated lift, tilts the foot to the slope. Only while idle, walking or running on the ground. Runs before the hold pose. The arm IK is now a shared `TwoBoneIK` helper.
- Verified (play mode, one online client, scripted input):
  - Sit: capsule 1.30 m, Sit state, zero movement under full stick, stands on release.
  - Slide: running 6 m/s → crouch → slide at 7.3 m/s → ends after 0.75 s → sits and brakes to 0 in 0.7 s → stands on release. Sit state throughout.
  - Strafe while carrying: MoveX +1.0 walking right, −1.0 running left, Walk→Run on speed.
  - Flinches: each hit side plays its clip at full weight, then the layer returns to 0.
  - Foot IK straddling the 0.30 m step: hips dropped 0.30 m, the floor-side ankle 0.08 m above the floor, the step-side one 0.06 m above the step. Captures with IK off and on show the floating foot planted.
  - Hold: wrists 0.05 m outside the block's side faces; the block stays clear of the chest from 0° to 60° of swing.
  - With the 0.40 m capsule: grabbed a block 1.25 m away; placed one on a ground block: settled at y 1.204 (1.2 exact), 3 cm off center, asleep within 0.5 s.
  - Console: no game errors (only the agent's test-tool errors).
- Decided: the slide clip plays above 2 m/s while sitting; flinches are full body (the clips step) and play once at normal speed whatever the stagger length.
- Assets: A-017 to A-020 delivered and integrated, removed from the list; A-024 added (strafe stride, slide motion; nice to have).
- Questions for Jackson: none new.
- Next: integrate A-021 (aim, jumpshot) when it lands, then A-022 and A-023, then the Phase 4 done-when.

## 2026-11-02: Pre-Phase 4, vertical camera while holding; docs reset
- Did: while holding a block, up/down input past the top (60°) or bottom (−25°) of the block's swing now tilts the camera, so the view can be aimed vertically while carrying. Not while aiming a throw (vertical input sets the throw angle there). View only (`OrbitCamera`, `LocalPlayerView`). Docs rewritten to the current build: history removed, `ASSETS.md` is now one priority list, the art pipeline moved into `PLAN.md`.
- Verified: compiles clean in the open editor (`unity recompile`). Not yet played by hand.
- Decided: the tilt takes exactly the input the swing can't use, so it starts at the edge and stops the moment input stops, with no drift.
- Assets: list reordered for Phase 4; new requests A-017 to A-023. Integrated items removed.
- Questions for Jackson: the Phase 3 play-test and the two open questions in the plan.
- Next: hold for art and Jackson's review, then Phase 4.
